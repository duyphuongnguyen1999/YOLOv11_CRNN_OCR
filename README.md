# YOLOv11-CRNN Scene Text Recognition

A deep learning-based advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed to detect and recognize text from images with high precision. Leveraging the power of YOLOv11 for accurate text detection and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) for robust text recognition, this project aims to provide an end-to-end solution for text extraction in diverse scenarios such as scanned documents, street signs, and natural scenes.

With a modular design and cutting-edge deep learning models, TextVisionAI ensures efficient and real-time performance, making it suitable for applications in document digitization, intelligent transportation, and automated form processing.
